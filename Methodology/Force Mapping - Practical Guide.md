# Force Mapping: Practical Guide

## Morning Practice

### First Light Map
```
1. Room Observation
   - Stand at threshold point
   - Note where light enters
   - Feel force directions
   - Mark in notebook

2. Force Documentation
   - Draw simple arrows
   - Note intensity (light/dark)
   - Mark movement direction
   - Show relationships

3. Pattern Recognition
   - Where forces meet
   - How they interact
   - What patterns emerge
   - Which portals open
```

### Worker Forces
```
1. Presence Documentation
   - Who is here
   - Where they gather
   - How they move
   - What they bring

2. Force Interaction
   - Between workers
   - With tools
   - Through space
   - Toward transformation

3. Pattern Emergence
   - Natural groupings
   - Force alignments
   - Movement flows
   - Portal openings
```

## Documentation Methods

### Simple Maps
```
Basic Elements:
- Arrows (force direction)
- Points (force centers)
- Lines (force connections)
- Spaces (force fields)

Documentation:
1. Quick Sketch
   - Basic arrows
   - Main points
   - Key connections
   - Clear spaces

2. Force Notes
   - Direction
   - Intensity
   - Interaction
   - Transformation

3. Pattern Recognition
   - Where forces meet
   - How they align
   - What emerges
   - Which portals open
```

### Gaussian Splat Integration
```
Process:
1. Force Photo
   - Capture space
   - Note light
   - Mark movement
   - Show relationship

2. Splat Processing
   - Map forces
   - Show intensity
   - Mark patterns
   - Reveal portals

3. Integration
   - Complete map
   - Force resolution
   - Pattern synthesis
   - Portal opening
```

## Practice Integration

### Morning Documentation
```
Simple Process:
1. Stand at threshold point
   - Feel forces
   - Note direction
   - Mark patterns
   - See portals

2. Quick Map
   - Basic arrows
   - Main points
   - Key connections
   - Clear spaces

3. Brief Notes
   - Force direction
   - Pattern recognition
   - Portal potential
   - Integration path
```

### Evening Completion
```
Integration Process:
1. Space Review
   - Complete observation
   - Force resolution
   - Pattern synthesis
   - Portal opening

2. Final Map
   - Full forces
   - Clear patterns
   - Open portals
   - Complete transformation

3. Documentation
   - Simple photos
   - Quick notes
   - Clear maps
   - True integration
```

## Remember

The mapping is:
- Not complex
- But clear and true
- Not forced
- But naturally emerging

Success looks like:
- Simple arrows
- Clear points
- True patterns
- Open portals

The practice remains:
- Stand at threshold point
- Draw initial force line
- Map exact coordinates
- Note emergence points

Key Elements:
- Start from stillness
- Map with precision
- Note all transformations
