# Inversion Maps: Conceptual Framework

## Primary Inversions

### Temporal Inversion
```
Traditional Time     →  Cloud Embassy Time
Past → Present → Future  ←→  Present Moment contains Past/Future
Linear Progression   →  Simultaneous Presence
Adding Knowledge     →  Revealing Understanding
```

### Spatial Inversion
```
Traditional Space         Cloud Embassy Space
Center → Periphery   ←→   Periphery → Center → New Periphery
Point to Field      ←→   Field to Point to New Field
Form to Space       ←→   Space to Form to New Space
```

### Force Inversion
```
Traditional Force        Cloud Embassy Force
Force → Form       ←→    Form → Force
Cause → Effect     ←→    Effect → Cause
Concept → Matter   ←→    Matter → Principle
```

## Practice Inversions

### Observation Method
```
Traditional         Cloud Embassy
Look → See    ←→    See ← Look
Add Detail    ←→    Remove Obscuration
Build Up      ←→    Reveal Within
```

### Documentation Method
```
Traditional              Cloud Embassy
Record What Is     ←→    Record What Forms
Document Result    ←→    Document Process
Fix in Time        ←→    Show Transformation
```

### Interface Layer
```
Traditional              Cloud Embassy
Visible Surface    ←→    Visible/Invisible Meeting
Boundary           ←→    Transition Zone
Separation         ←→    Connection Point
```

## Movement Maps

### The 142857 Cycle
```
Traditional: Linear Progression
1 → 4 → 2 → 8 → 5 → 7 → 1

Cloud Embassy: Simultaneous Movement
1 ⇄ 4
4 ⇄ 2
2 ⇄ 8
8 ⇄ 5
5 ⇄ 7
7 ⇄ 1
```

### Force Field Movement
```
Traditional Force Field
Source → Movement → Result

Cloud Embassy Field
Result ← Movement → Source
     ↓         ↑
  New Result ← New Movement
```

### Pattern Recognition
```
Traditional Pattern
Detail → Pattern → Principle

Cloud Embassy Pattern
Fragment → Force → Formation
     ↓        ↑
New Fragment ← New Force
```

## Remember

These maps are not fixed diagrams but dynamic tools for understanding inversion. Each can be read in multiple directions, revealing different aspects of the same transformation. The arrows (→ ←→ ⇄) indicate not just direction but the quality of movement between states.

Use these maps as:
- Tools for reorienting observation
- Guides for practice development
- References for understanding transformation

The goal is not to replace traditional understanding but to reveal its complement, allowing us to work with both simultaneously - like seeing both the red of the tomato and the green it has absorbed.
