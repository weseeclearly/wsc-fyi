almost take the human out, not that style isn't important, but maybe there's something beyond style, which actually promotes integration rather than a sense of lack and wanting., if you know what I mean. moving beyond the impulse to have what you don't, to be attracted but what about self- similarity and integration, and assimilation? is that a possible vector for information retainment? seeing the WHOLE picture not coveting a ceratin style or angle? I guess some would call this a dimensional jump, like becoming something or grokking it, rather than just seeing it from your own perspective of desires.
