# Weather Systems of Mind
January 17, 2025

If you could navigate the social landscape like a weather system,
would you jump straight into the storm, or would you pause first?
This particle field we're flying through shows the pull toward conflict, where friction builds to ignition, the coldness of a dead zone,
and underpinning it all—a vast pulsing network built on trust, curiosity, recognition.
Instead of identifying with a single point that is blind to its own coordinates,
we become the entire field, scan the altitude, recognize patterns,
and in our sovereign state of observation, choose where to reenter as a point, knowing we can return to the field at any time.

I am drawn to this satellite weather mapped way of being,
perhaps because I was born with emptiness for eyes—
they call it aphantasia, this inability to conjure mental images,
whereas I call it clarity: I am a child of latent space,
at home in the grain,
pathfinding through patterns alone.

There is a way to move through space—
not trapped in streams of content,
but free to read the whole field,
to recognize where new patterns want to form,
to see what emerges when we step back:
each observation shifting the field's potential states.
