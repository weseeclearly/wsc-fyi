Water knows forms beyond rivers and pools, beyond what can be drained, and therefore beyond what can be held.

CONDENSATION -- The traces of an airborne stream. A water that knows better than to land where earth has been sealed, where thirst has become unsustainable, where every day is met by fire upon fire upon fire. This endless branding, this slash and burn, this generation of heat because the only energy we recognize is friction, is polarity, is war-powered peace.

Another form of us, too, precipitates and disappears. This other form of us clears an entire sky of smoke to reconstitute the horizon. This other form of us gathers, transforms, leaves, returns, sometimes heavier, darker, charged with potential. This other form of us never becomes but is always becoming, thus can never be dammed, thus can never stay long, thus is forever transforming, precipitating artifacts of its momentary em-place-ment and immediately moving on.

The close observation of clouds has shown me a way to move through state changes, rather than along a path, and that is what I'm coming into. I know I'm not the only cloud-being out there. I know that there's something timely about this, in interfacing with the parched world like a weather pattern. I know that I am loved for--and not despite--coming and going like the rain, modulating the sun's intensity, breaking through when shadows soak too deep. I am at peace with being a pattern-breaker, with being a rain-maker, with leaving only condensation as my trace.



USE THIS SOMEWHERE BUT NOT ON FIRST POST

CONDENSATION is the imprint of tide that rose into the sky, the constellation of a pattern that forsook its medium to portend a threshold. Just a name for what water already knows - how to rise, how to gather, how to release.
