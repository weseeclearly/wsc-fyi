powerful how Alice Weidel enters in super strong and basically tries to get people emtionally pulled into all the things that are wrong with Germany, and then 
Oliver brings it back to - ok, so put this in the framework of what POLICIES you plan to enact if you become Chancellor.

this strategy brings it back to actually seeing the things that would be changed, in the form of something more objective that people can evaluate on their own terms, rather than just hearing a narrative that is emotional without checking what the policies are...

very strong move.

it's like, letting the person talk rather than becoming personally involved and trying to argue something.  this is a very sophisticated approach.
