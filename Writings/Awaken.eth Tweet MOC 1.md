- with content now automated, the only thing left is awakening
- The fire that burns at infinity, obscuring the meeting of parallel lines
- Utility is not fulfillment
-  **_₊˚ ⋆.࿐ ⋆ ｡˚ ੈ ✩‧₊ ˚ ⋆.ೃ ✼　 ҉　 ⋆
- intelligence bound by wisdom
- a little nothing that changes everything (butterfly)
-  removing the distraction of belonging
- The present is thicc
##### Opinions (PIN DROP)
- my ego is dead when I see that anyone can be me. I love that.
- 3d for creators as a way to go through material creation experiences like animation, cutting, modeling, clay, etc, but not having to waste the material. so it's 3d as a leraning tool, and then a creating tool, and maybe it also translates to consumption too. but it's very fantastic for this. (blender cell shaer animatinon)
- Clarity before Strength
	  Tone before Style
	  Impact before Growth
- novelty through actual change not just trend splicing
- the social overlay of your needs = your desire
- I'm interested in the overlay. the contrast, the juxtaposition between those two
	I think we can show those things very splendidly.
- decode the intention behind all messaging.
- bad design is unethical
- AI makes bartering possible again. Lossy money transactions vs direct item for item if the demand is out there. And totally outside of the monetary system which is excellent.
- consistency, resonance, regularity, integrity that shake off all unnecessary things
- complexity is most often a mask. 
- Hypothesis : we all share the same purpose.
- there is evil in this world, and it would serve us all to name it, and to understand that it exists within us too. That it knows us so intimately ,that we are born of it, and that we should get to know it, and respect it, and then separate from it.
- know what to scale
- Goals are not emergent. Values are not emergent. Steps are emergent 
- so many people building so many words that further densify the chaos and the brokenness.... it is just fortifying it. (films, stories)
- real education would inform people not to buy into consumerist society, so that';s why education is actually indoctrination, ensalvement
	- examples - the art you love you can actually make
	- the food you eat, you can actually make
	- the huse you want, maybe not be the one that you think
	- the city you live in, maybe killing you/driving you insane
- Twitter just proves there's a million ways to say the same thing. Very rare do I come across something that feels new and informative. Information is only important if it irrevocably changes a system... most of this is just reinforcing.
- Same with AI. a million ways to depict the same thing. Mostly just psychosis or neurosis or lust.
- compound interest -> compound theft / compound distortion - it goes both ways
- habit gets in the way of presence
- presence is the only balancing vector. because balance is remaining conscious always.
- the metric of diversity over productivity (or resilience vs efficiency). Switch what we're gamed for
- biomass increases with extinction, more and more bulk. Less SPACE and less dark matter. hmmmm !!!! so interesting. Density.
- a world of bugs + microbial slime
- medeia, not gaia. life doing it to itself
- humanity lacks coherent narratives. how do you explain war to a kid?
- for me to live, something else has to die
- turning sunlight into dopamine...
- simplify now and beat the rush to reduce and offload... get value now for what won't have value in the future.
- you let go by choosing something else

##### Engagement (Question)
- "if you had all the resources in the world what would you do?"
- tag soul fam
- How can an imperfect human being be sure that he is contributing positively i.e. not getting stuck in imperfection and therefore not taking action for fear of consequences his imperfectness can't see?
- why is clothing sizing so shit
- show me your algorithm (screenshot of youtube suggestions, tiktok suggestions, etc.)
- have this dream that I would be able to see my digital double to trace out all patterns of behavior etc but in lieu of that, just gonna look at myself through recommendations. it's all there already. I don't need it to be put into a beautiful little emoji self, because then it's not true. I want to see it how it is seen. 
- everything is already talking to us, we just have to listen. Especially those spaces that are neglected... as stewards, we can see exactly why certain things don't get attention. The angles of those things, the access, the light, and what DOES live there, what DOES love the spaces we overlook, what can thrive in those spaces, and how we can learn to value them.
- no conversations. just show me your feed. then we will know why we are talking and what we're talking about. 
- weird way to start the morning but... how would you explain war to a kid?
- what do YOU do with power asymmetry (balance forces, education vs leverage)?
- Do you need money to have impact?
- Why do we remain hypnotised by things of no importance
- AI - deterministic (same seed same generation, despite seeming infinite variation still deterministic) vs life - generative or teleological 


##### Inversions & Correlations
- Direction over Perfection
- 3. The original is that which is unownable - it is the source of life. Everything that is ownable is a copy. If an original seems to be owned, it is a perturbation or an illusion - ultimately an illusion that we uphold, that does not serve the greater good. Because a true original is life giving and to own a life giver is a demonic thing.
- things that are necessary for life are free -it's the unnecessary things, the discretionary things, that become huge cash cows. when something is deemed necessary it cannot be charged like that. so look at hwat you're being harge dfor , and what is available, and then pursue what is abundant and free.
- cognitive empathy  (faking emotive, modeling, performing) vs emotive empathy 
- Whole foods, fractional food... whole assets, fractionalised assets... Will history repeat itself? Are we learning the same lessons over and over again????
- most people look out and all they see are themselves
- complexity = devolved state of mind
- massive information asymmetry = massive power asymmetry
- spontaneity(intuition) vs impulse 
- When you have a big enough platform you are not reporting on a story you are not sharing ideas you are creating the narrative and that's the power of or maybe that's kind of the underlying aspiration of a lot of contact creators is actually to be story writers for how humans perceive the world because it's so not based in truth it's based in relativity
- let go with me
- desire to appear but not to be - consciousness/system (allatra definition)
- calamity = a hangover after revelry
- noticing what the world has, and dwhat it needs, where everyone's looking and where no one dares to go
- Destructive externalities of creativity
- Contracts are based on results which lead to control & servitude
		- Vows drive actions which lead toward freedom
- we have power over everything except the result. enneagram. (> over reactions)
 - if we try to control everything then that's black magic.
 - effort alone is doomed to fail. "I will try" is the opposite of a definitive statement. It's because will is not reliable, it comes and goes, or we could put it another way - effort is a result of conditions (will is here, will isn't here, accountability is here, accountability isn't here) but all of this is external in a sense to the DIRECTION of a vow, of a principle, of an unwavering truth. 51% conditions or vow. Deadlines are a contract, and therefore also will cause a pendulum swing backwards.
 -  to live in a world full of talent rather than to stand out as that talent
 - thought experiment: 200 years in the future, you find a journal. What is the most interesting thing you could possibly read in there? probably something mundane... not some crazy "timeless" thought but rather something real, that collapses time. OR, is totally bizarre, like some description of something that is totally archaic. does this aproach objective description?
 - - correlation : higher primary market price , lower secondary vs lower primary but equal secondary.. or even better, raw ingredient free alchemy super expensive. Like clothes!! hehe (a case study, art, clothing, etc. What can have a higher secondary price + royalties?)


##### Society
1.  We train kids to be fixed in their concepts … to live in a conceptual world. There is a chasm between fantasy and feeling - we need to work toward integration not justification/escapism 

##### Art
1. let art be you, living
2. - midjourney - so many people in creative flow that no one's even looking at what other people are making. all creators no curators no middlemen. Profound implications here.
3. every artwork is a Rorschach test. What you see is what you bring to it, or how you contain it. The best artworks neutralize or do not react to evil, and amplify goodness and harmony.
4. Become an artist to appreciate the art in everything 
5. distortion vs essence in art
6. physical is for resourcefulness and relations. Digital is for objective art, mathematical, modeling
7. art is the threshhold of conscousness running experiments to better understand itself.
8. I think music is the most powerful media we have. there's SO much room to explore as well. 99% of what's heard and replayed has the same theme (pathological relationships) and the same meter (4/4) lfg
9. - Western art and thought is a inter disconnected story of hypertrophies. Developments that overextend a medium to compensate for specialisation. It's the fallacy of infinite progress and development rather than closing the circle or taking an objective holistic perspective. 

##### Etymology
1. [[Discord - naming - DAOs in chaos]]


##### Symbology
2. Language is our strongest self propagating meme

##### Identity Mapping
- A very simple check is, nothing in your true purpose will ever be built on these things like fear, greed, pride, etc.
- I am a sampler
- Life snapshots - across all domains
- Stick to your own path or you'll never learn to navigate.
   - path is different but direction is same. compass analogy
- why I don't make art about my identity, my sexuality, my ____________ ___ put in blank here (though I'm interested in how it may come through in a more embodied way)


##### Attention & Emotion & Right Action & Objectivity
- WE must outgrow to grow
- preconditions (for flowering) preconditions : conditions
- DECIDE WHAT MATTERS MOST  
	- DECIDE WHEN YOU'LL DO WHAT MATERS MOST  
	- SQUEEZE ALL OTHER THINGS AROUND IT
- looking for more facts, data that tells stories, etc. stop the interpretation. Let me do that part. Stop the stylistic stuff. Also -- map what is there to know what isn't there. What is missing from our models of how things work? Who is missing from the conversation? What conversation can we have, and what conversations can we not have? 
- The principle of excess energy, not knowing where to put it, it backfires and we literally supercharge bad emotions and bad actions. We just need to reduce the energy, to be more considerate of it, and then learn in pace with energy use... relates to coffee as well.
- steward of negative spcae... not just showing gorgoeus interiors that remain only for the elite, but literally places that are so unseen in their seeming unpretentiousness, their simplicity, their plainness, and finding value in that.
-  organization <-> energy
 - harmonic series - compound numbers - absolute and relative - also related to BOC and the gaussian curve / chasms - starting small, focusing on the start, the momentum, rather than the absolute, and moving past blocks.
 - more electricity/charge outside, less inside. it's so easy when you understand polarity and where to look for balance/the truth.
##### Meta (could these also be captions?)
- if you have something truly to say (That is in service to making sense of this world) then design takes a back seat while simultaneously offering something actually new and exciting.
- Thank you for your good comments, your praise is my greatest affirmation.
- I hope to find a network of reciprocity where we can empower each other towards good and liberation.
- "Nevertheless, claiming that abstract techniques of knowledge and artificial metalanguages belong uniquely to the modern industrial West is not only historically inaccurate but also an act and one of implicit _epistemic colonialism_ towards cultures of other places and other times." e-flux
- always look for exceptions to your mental models, not those things that confirm it. NEgate your own bias.
- transcending relativity
- gifts are that which we can give infinitely. We come into life with certain gifts; we can give those. but we are also to engage with what we’re naturally not very good at. To become WHOLE again. to be parts, and to be wholes, simultaneously.
- all permutations of style, individual expression, etc. are flavors on top of an original code that finds itself again through beauty
- we are in our current predicament because our INTENTIONS are good but we act through the conditioning or distortion of the state of our internal affairs.. .so if they are in disorder or headed in a negative direction then EVERYTHING WE DO regardless of the intention will be negatively impactful. Intention is only SPEED and POWER of execution, not ABSOLUTE VALUE.
- I know I am not alone in this. But do you know that you are with me?
- we're eating our capital, whereas we could be eating our interest... what if we really acted like the rich, but in relation to the environment. TRUE RICHNESS not noveau riche
- The epidemic of charlatanism
- desire to appear but not to be - illusion of shortcuts
- how to be above and beyond the abuse of what we know
- gold and blue robes - inner and outer circles of a flame
- druids captured the rays of sun on a reflecting glass
- reflections of the fires that burn forever in the heavens
- does information change perception, or is it that we're not really perceiving in the first place?
- From appearance to essence in all things 
- Formal structure to revelation 
- The proneos of a temple, a gate leading in to an inner sanctuary of inner knowing, then even the simplest things men do become emblems of the deepest things men seek. Everything men do is a symbol, an emblem. The great journey into homelessness … leave behind all fixations and points and inevitabilities. No final forms exist here. 
- a different kind of scale... there's the scale of extraction, which is an imbalanced scale or growth. Then there's the scale of actually seeing the thing you hide, as an asset of equal and important and compounding value. I.e. the painter who also presents his palettes in some form, makes something of them, as a sort of record of his own work... as INSIGHT into what is happening. Scaling growth, awareness, scaling synchronization and harmonics, so that people are working together toward something instead of competing. What kind of scale grows monopolies and competition, i.e. cancer, and what kind of scale would actually grow resilience? diversity? From which vantage point are we looking at scale or growth?
- insight through conduct
- nothing that is real can be old or new.
- religions "created as gates not to themselves but through themselves" - manly p hall, wisdom of persia, albert pike
- man may outgrow his master but can never outgrow his gratitude to his master - manly p hall wisdom of persia, albert pike
- to perceive you must become - mph ""
- we are not sinners, we are Truth seekers -mph ""
- change the definition of "to be present"
- 99% of the advice out there will actually set you back
- The economy of emotions. The moment emotion enters, value is skewed
- In stillness you see patterns around you. You understand the nature of our world
- Psychic ability is to land on the question, work is to answer the question. There is nothing easy in this life, there is god's will and our material precision (hands)
- some things fall off and some things need to be forcibly removed.
- the purpose of the dishwasher is to free human consciousness to grow
- News is called programming for a reason
- fear is a niche.
- Remember that by communicating things or imagining things you may only be pursuing the emotion and if the emotion has been received and the action will not be completed we must remove the emotion from action and remember that things still have to be completed
##### INTERFACING
- digital double - avatar created from the eyes of Facebook and Google
- I look at social media like moving averages eliminate the candles and just look at the slopes because at the end of the day we know that zooming into far will get you Pauline and directions are in a long-term is totally unsupportable. In other words, the only social media that I really pay attention to our underline behavioural graphs actions speak so much louder than words words are noise and I miss lady Rose on the timer
- To the algorithms- I don't care about anything and will not click on anything that distracts me from enlightenment and cleaning up this earth. It is a waste of resources to show me anything else. 
- observe yourself. compare yourself to yourself. Know what came before, and after, and discover truth in your analysis. It would serve everyone to be more analytical about themselves, to recognize that most of what happens within us is mechanical, not conscious, and therefore can be simplified into correlations rather than let loose in a chaos of open uncorrelated interpretations.
- what medicine do we bring into our lives but never take
- mantra meditation - focus - bringing up interfaces in the mind which are practically more useful for focus than looking an external screen because the former has no other wills stealing your attention whereas computer screen is designed by nature to compel you towards other things.
    - funny thing about compound interest is that we look at those numbers in absolute while the percentage is relative, and also, the meaning is relatie once you get into those numbers. harmonics, where C 254 is C2 512 is C3 1024 etc. the number is double but the resonance is the same. So, what does that mean?
- can't really cheat because it will short circuit. the most important thing is rhythm and consistency so if you bring in too much foreign energy it will throw everything off and the system can't really calibrate again.... so, better to introduce things a little bit at a time so as not to throw off the rhythm.
- finish what you started before you start something new. Why is this true? because we'll never get into the flow of compouding if we never have enough energy dedicated to that one direction, or to make sure that we achieve regularity in at least one area of our lives.
- factor in the externalities, like 60 days of trading and then spending all that on a hotel room is just fucked UP. there shouldn't be this separation in our consciousness of such values, i.e. spending 5 hours trying to get a refund when we blow money like crazy in other areas, or make money like crazy... be more real, and more whole.


##### Comprehension & Contemplation
- Arpeggiating knowledge - how to know things better
- Evil as an active force or passive force. It is constantly improving itself to fool the soul. Active does not mean that it has a soul... AI also learns and self corrects. Just stuck within some system. So do not discount evil or think that it is immature or stuck in a low state of development. Respect it for its cunning. Goethe the quality of shadow ?
- I will be judged _> who is judging me -> I don't care about the perceived who -> resolution
- 3. we are not different from our ancestors. All of the amazing things they made (especially like woven textiles, the hilltribes of vietnam) are in some ways confining for those people who do not want to wear them anymore. We have new, non-local tribes that are emerging, our costumes are in other intricacies, and we have to relish that we STILL are the same people and yet we are able to choose and emerge new forms of intricate garb, whether it is garb at all. Identify these new tribes as a think piece and then also show the tribal outfits that are being co-created.

##### Materiality
- No man possesses anything. All possessions possess man. Therefore we want to make our load as light as possible. 
- How to enjoy not having
- Nothing is priceless what we can get along without.
- money value is only a tribute  to it in an era of inflated economic consciousness. Either worthless or valuable.
- All creations are an illusion but they tell something 
- We're heading against decay with "permanent assets" but is that really the best we can do ? Does happiness fade?
- You might be to poor to buy , but you're not too poor to make
- Accumulator vs collector
- the leisure class is wealthy enough to afford misery
- everything that I own should serve to free me
- What if we came into a train and thought, wow how beautiful and how lucky, I will do everything in my power to keep this thing clean and functioning because it is a part of what I own, extended ownership to everything, I am a stewars
- Obsession with novelty keeps you in debt for a lifetime 
- Freedom for me = freedom to pursue knowledge and access it and the best teachers That is mainly free as long as I can afford my rent going forward. So all money should be saved to carry those base costs.
- There is no freedom in possession(s)
- AI made me bored of all styles

##### Poke
- What have you unlearned today? #unlearneveryday
- what music were YOU programmed by? "india arie"
- MORAL UNEASE
- Before we build anything, let's stop breaking everything?

##### Higher Harmonics / Äther Forces / Insight
- When our overtones perish our world perishes
- Spiral symmetry vs linear progression. Life choice . Linear progression ignores externalities. Spiral symmetry puts them in place
- sketching - sketching the underlying geometry and the formula that would result in the growth pattern of that thing. So instead of sketching textures, somehow capturing the MOVEMENT or the action of that object, so that it is a totally different kind of painting... a painting of the essential movement or seed ,rather than the phenomenological form.
- We are incomplete until we collapse time, which is really just knowledge-grokking
- If it can be framed, then it’s not the whole picture 
- the atlantians - El - they taught us how to harvest grain in order to make us more stupid and more like animals.

##### Mementos / Cloud Embassy Triggers
- no matter what medium, angel runs clear
- omni 0321

##### Psyche
- We think depression is something complex... simply correlate how much care you take, vs. how much you give. And then forget about all of the higher levels of that dynamic and simply go outside and pick up trash off some public space. I guarantee you you will feel better, for having done something objectively good (which is very hard to come by) in this world. Step by step.
- even if we "fix" global warming, what next? what world will we "go back to?" more wars, more scarcity, more us vs them, more content, more ????? maybe that's why there's no motivation to work together on this... people don't want to go on.
- Climate change - give up what we don’t have anyway (a sense of purpose, life, possibility)

##### Interpersonal
- relationships are about what we can accomplish together.
- The need for legitimisation is the root of all manipulation
- loneliness is directly correlated to one's capacity to take the perspective of others. Sociopaths dominate the higher echelons of power hierarchies... they feel the lonelinest. they are looking for otherness but attempt through domination. 

##### Titles
- "these are the codes that I offer and these are the codes that I need"
- If it can be framed, then it’s not the whole picture 
- I do not believe in this land that I see
- Birdsong, Wind, and Water

3. [[Sustainability]]
4. [[the problem of pristine clothing]]
5. [[the problem of complicated to construct clothing]]]


##### Op Eds (in progress - maybe merge with key topics?)

2. [[The Alchemy of Repair]]

##### Nested MOCs
1. [[Pattern Design MOC]]
2. [[Zero Waste MOC]]

##### Related MOCs
[[Awaken.eth Tweet MOC]]

##### Diagrams
1. all the parts of a circular economy around fashion - + the areas where MetaFactory is focused. Even two areas would be amazing... but it takes all of us to build it. Then name organizations tackling each of those areas, and include the instagram woman and her research.
2. show all the externalities as graphs, + the normal business model, and show how it actually costs us every tmie we produce a t-shirt. That profit costs us. Look at better combinations of externalities + what's accounted.
3. wearing my earnestness on my sleeve, like hey let's talk about ~ on the back of a t-shirt, or I'm a highly sensitive person and often put in ear plugs. conversation starter. lol


##### R&D
1. [[industrial processes of recycling fibers are still too far away from people to make the connection that WE have the power to alchemize those materials back into use.]]

2. [[Sustainability]]
3. [[Fashion is our analog augmented reality]]
4. [[the problem of pristine clothing]]
5. [[the problem of complicated to construct clothing]]
6. [[how can collab be incentivized by design itself?]]

8. [[decoupling fashion brand from having to produce more and more clothes]]
9. [[bundled production]]
10. [[hurdles to overcome in producing a modular web3 friendly fashion experiment]]
11. keep in mind that fashion has always moved economies, not just post industrial age. Jewelry trade, beads, gold, these things have ALWAYS been important! tyrian purple dye grew an empire "For the ancient Phoenicians, from modern-day Lebanon, the trade in Tyrian purple helped build a mercantile empire that established new colonies across the Mediterranean, including at Carthage, near modern Tunis, under the mythical Queen Dido." https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/oddly-enough/tunisian-enthusiast-recreates-sea-snail-purple-dye-that-defined-ancient-royals-2022-02-08/
12. it used to be colors that were rare... then watches, etc. what will it be in the digital age? what is rare in digital abundance? truly? What is really hard to make? Will it be something determined from above, or will we agree on an artificial scarcity to create meaning for us? meaning that is aligned with what is good for us, and not just tapping into scarcity/exclusivity/elitism? When we have the power to build these systems, what will we choose?
13. [[our relationship to color]]
14. What’s baked into the industry of Fashion need not pilfer the medium.
15. Fashion is the software bundle that everyone subscribes to
16. Fashion is the software bundle that everyone subscribes to—what’s bundled inside invariably shapes our lives. Some scripts have delivered more harm than good, so MetaFactory is tinkering with alternatives. We hope, through small-scale intervention, to attract collaborators, and drive transformation through inspiration.
17. Sandy dolphin fashion superficial when you mention it in the context of other people who are doctors or architects my relationship with Cassie fashion as a language in some senses it's the only thing that still lives from my ancestors it's the order a gift for life it's the combination of colours that Kerry language when books are burned for people forget so I see it as a code
18. [[why are all web3 fashion projects just runt physical twins]]
19. fashion needs a rebranding from clothes to global awakening ,regeneration, re-enchantment. imagine if those became synonymous.
20. core creative challenge = making provenance, used look, desireable.

23. Where does fashion fit into a solarpunk world?
24. [[What does decentralized fashion LOOK like? - in response to the question, what is a crypto native fashion movement?]]
25. [[industrial processes of recycling fibers are still too far away from people to make the connection that WE have the power to alchemize those materials back into use.]]
26. How do we account for most stalwarts of sustainable fashion have been through a whole consuemr cycle themselves? going from fast fashion to something beyond... can we expect that every single person is going to be beter than us at skipping the cycle and going straight to the gold? No. So how can we build in a world that allows for some mistakes along the way, but ultimately leads toward better behavior?> are we the best exampels of that? Do we question our own behaviors enough?
27.
