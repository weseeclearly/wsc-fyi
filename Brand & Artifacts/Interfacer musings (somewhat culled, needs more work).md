##### Study the Interface

- all you need is one year to experience growth beyond your wildest dreams. consistency.
	I've chosen this year to be the year of total transformation of being. IT can seem like a bad way to start, expecting a result, but there is no expectation here. There is the matter of factness of a certain series ofa ctions that, if carried out, will produce a state of being that is transformed, that is awakened. And knowing the map, somehow secures the action, and challenges me to take the steps that I need to take and not let the doubt get in the way. IT is interesting, because my success is not contingent on how it is received. IT is simply in carrying out the actions, knowing that these actions ARE the actual variables that constitute success. The rest is out of my control, how they are received is of no import, really. which is interesting. This is the difference.

- those chosen steps are :
	journaling in the open. here : wsc.fyi
	launching a clothing brand, first principles, because clothing is our longest history.
	releasing a newsletter and carrying on this twitter account
	

- it's not a real adventure if someone else has the map. I don't believe that anyone is free from the corruption of power, and if someone knows your moves, then nothing you do will ever ultimately serve your freedom, because they need you in the game. So, the first object for all of us is to become map-readers, by orienting within this space to the point that we understand how it was created, and what the rules are of the game or the interface. We should be looking at every provocation as something with a deeper incentive for the game master. We should not be so easily distracted. We should first let go of the notion or fantasy that our free will comes from ignorant adventuring. Nothing new will be found here.
- anonymity can be a container for reformulation, reintegration, etc. but is not a permanent state; it is a temporary chrysalis.
- wearing values on your sleeve or selling a brand beacuse of its good values is akin to starting off in a paradox, bound by two separate value sytems and trying to find peace between them publicly. it isn't going to work. you will get torn down. IF you have good values, then do what needs to be done to give you the grounding to then enact those good values. No one else needs to know. Be good, through and through, and do whatever it takes to do the most good. Maybe some day the conditions of this world will actually connect the front and and the back end but right nwo they really aren't connected, and I don't think given the way the world is going, they will be. We have to accept that as an evolution of our world, a choie that we have made, and something that we need to work with and separate.
- Why does beauty matter? I believe that intuition/attraction drives curiosity which leads to knowledge. That beauty can inspire a lifetime of inquiry, and that inquiry can lead to real contribution and real satisfaction. 

Everyone's so READY To play in someone else's game
	But the odds are always stacked against you if it's someone else's game
	seems like a simple rule, and yet people fall for it over and over and over and over again.

what if the best marketers in the world did an ad campaign for earth
	1. Imagining a future path that isn’t critical against the system but rather the best minds thinking about better paths that the system can take (or the actors in the system) now… if this is possible. No one knows. But worth a try

##### Fashion / Branding

- ==It is a brand that eschews labels because it is signed through and through.

- ==**Brand as Destination** (false, there is only one destination and it can't be a brand, owned by someone who benefits from siphoning off of you) 
	vs

- **Brand as Ship** (how to know if the brand wants to actually get you to that place? How to sustain the brand as a good ship leader? more people taking the journey! and good reviews that they actually get there!)

- New Fashion Ecology - Reorient all negatives into learnings and positives. I.e. brands will always fail if they act as destinations or try to capture all the value themselves... however if they become VESSELS then they can capture immense amounts of value without creating fragility or monopoly because they are a UTILITY. The utility of fashion is mobility and aspiration and first impressions!

- ==Brand as prompting station

- correlation : higher primary market price , lower secondary vs lower primary but equal secondary.. or even better, raw ingredient free alchemy super expensive. Like clothes!! hehe

##### Core Creative Challenges
- value back-end, cool front-end. not the other way around
- 
	- utility > sterility (value in how repaired something is vs. how new it is)
	- entropy vs negentropy with clothing



##### Organization & Coordination

1. The less organizational structure, the more each individual must be structured 
2. Know which rung is your rung, an analogy would be ... are you a programmer, a tool user, an end user? Or another example - 3d printer. Are you more interested in building the printer or actually using it to make things? They are very different and you should knoww which it is!!! There's also a difference between intellectual curiosity and action curiosity.
3. 

"The Hierarchy of Integration"

Depolarize everything by expanding the mindframe so that more and more gets included into the mental model



"Rank" as complexity, i.e. more and more complex rituals and symbols that give the impression of a highly complex, secret thing... which attaches one to certain badges, titles, etc.

"Rank" as wholeness, i.e. the understanding of fundamental realities and forces so that you become fluent and able to basically engage across many domains. So that you can see the sign in every object, so that everything beomces a ship/point of relation rather than a point of fixation, all pointing to the ultimate destination or the next destination we should say.

HOW THIS LOOKS : instead of adding more and more ribbons which are just tangles and turns using the same basic principles, making a garment that has to be stored basically in a bubble to protect it (no high ranking official would ever be seen wearing something dirty, which is actually antithetical to really knowing this world.. that dirtiness is only on the inside, that external things can be dirty and it doesn't matter, i.e. an externalization of what should be an internal process)




So, in clothing we have the art of repair, the art of seams, of holding things together, of body, skin, materials, breathability, etc. 

Dear one,

The interface has no buttons. It is a true reflector

the interface shows a screen... loading all data, retrieving all data from all public sources, and configuring your double for greater insight into your weaknesses and strengths, maybe to shed light on your purpose according to what is needed today and also what you can offer. We all can do something that is needed. it is part of our chemistry.

it responds to sound, to movement, to feel, to touch. to eyes closed, it might do something else.

use existing apps AND NAME THEM to achieve what you want to... 

WRITE DOWN ALL THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE MADE but just explain them really well.... beause you literally can't make them all. you just don't have the time.

It's an audio project, a project of prompting / looking for my soul family
I cannot learn everything though I want to. I cannot make everything though I want to. My big push is two-fold

Share the idea. Share the framework. Share the frame. Let the space be open, but wire it in a way that the lattice is STRONG and inspiring.

Then also clean up. Clean up. Put the materials and such back into play

don't get too hung up on perfecting the look of things. JUST GET THE IDEAS OUT

the minimum support that cloud embassy needs tos tart to take shape.... work with SOUND AND VIBRATION OF THE INTENTION don't worry so much about the MATERIAL!!!!
