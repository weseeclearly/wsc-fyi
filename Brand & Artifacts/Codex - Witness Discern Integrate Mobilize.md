my dream is that instead of being manipulated by stuff we take three passes, first assessing its pull on us, then decoding its intention, then deciding whether to give it any attention or not based on alignment with our values. if the world did this we would collapse the entire false construct and actually free ourselves completely. see decode the intentions behind all messaging (visual, literary, whatever) and then assess

I guess then I'm launching ~~a brand~~ healing waters

WDIM

(WHAT DOES IT MEAN)

WITNESS DISCERN INTEGRATE MAKE
WITNESS DISCERN IMAGINE MAKE

realizing now that wdim becomes Witness Discern Integrate Make - as a methodology connecting fashion designers and artists to businesses basically as creative front end consulting because they understand the culture of uptake. and THIS is how you scale the skills. Expand what fashion can be. fashion will change, as we change, as we develop new technologies. 

the roadmap is:

timeless gorgeous grails,
100% handmade by yours truly.

Hoping what I make resonates

Will be putting things up piece by piece here:

Taking this breather from words to live the stories I love to tell.


Define integrity
Define fashion
Link out to WDIM, maybe this should just be a Figma link or something as a genesis of the brand (figma works for public display, no?)

"recreated breadcrumb trails aren't breadcrumb trails!!!! so I'm just... actually leaving the breadcumb trail"

create youtube live stream channel and add link

Roots continue to grow, flowers come and go

ss above, so below, connected by a stem where the nutrients flow

what is your phase? are you in bloom, or are you waiting for a surge of energy?
more understanding around how people show up

if we are selling cool people to investors, then we have to start collecting those people too. what is our attraction for those people if they can‚Äôt contribute money? what are we offering to them, then?

always think of curation
and credit
and that long chain of porovenance
you are not to relate your own means
just cuerate
CURATE

trend vs heirloom

algorithm = homogeneity 
whereas physical objects -> organic connection and emergence

A brief message for context:

WDIM stands for What Does It Mean? and it is a cultural movement, the water to an entire landscape of growth. 

our reigning analogy or metaphor is that of a plant, roots and all, surrounded by water cycles. WDIM is the water cycle and the plant is how we are organizing our fields of emergence. Within a plant, you have flowers (which appear and disappear), roots (which continue to grow), and stems which carry the nutrients between the two and also have the strength to grow upwards even though cement and such.

the main expression of WDIM is a focus on very specific lines of inquiry around which communities form. These people are not brought together by a sort of social magnetism, but rather by an alignment and resonance with a purpose or direction or line of inquiry, such as ‚Äúhuman - nature interfaces‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat does it mean to be human?‚Äù or ‚Äúmonetary diversity‚Äù . things like that. but phrased as questions.

communities arise AROUND people basically discerning other people who share their approach, through worn objects. This could be first in identifying already existing stylistic choices, which transcend trend, but then when WDMI scales, it will be through actual objects that are either purchased, earned, or crafted through instructions.

we are focusing on physical objects that do not have digital components, precisely because the current way of meeting people -algorithmically - drives toward homogeneity. Because ultimately the purpose of the algorithms is to better identify people so that they become customers.

with physical objects that maybe get photographed and distributed only in image, digitally, the connection point is curiosity and wonderment, not divisiveness and opinions. It is about reconnecting to the organic web of interactions which naturally invites diversity for the health of the system. it is about tuning into our natural response toward people who are expressing themselves in very specific and intentional ways. And then basically tracking those emergent communities (non local emergent communities) through the sort of archetypical object which would represent them.

the first object we‚Äôre creating is a torque bracelet,which is a twist of silver +the shredded shellac‚Äôd parts of our WDIM vision statement. It is a wearable art object, which combines wearability with a gesture of intent. There will be eight of these bracele,ts and we intend to attract the first ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù from this bracelet, which would represent visionaries with capital.

I think that‚Äôs enough context for now. What I want from our conversation, ist o craft that initial charter, or vision statement, in the most succinct and clear and also profoundly impactive statement possible. What I like about your writing, Daniel, is that you are pragmatic and not very emotional, though you can evoke emotions in readers. I hate flowery, cliche, pitch-y language that promises ‚Äúfirst ever: or ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù - no, we are humble , we recognize that what we are doing is on the shoulders of giants, and that we are simply returning and refining a way of life that is intrinsic to humans, not some sort of technical or trendy overlay or pull for finances.
