ctrl alt divinity

all my video ideas and such here. I will go through them too, but would prefer it to be like a guidebook for tons of people to feed into. that there's really nothing if it's just me doing it alone.

all the ideas, all of it kind of exist here in this latent space... again, I will chip away at it, but can we just set a bunch of agents on it too?

                                    the lattice
                                             the space

I’ve been working on a project for 2 1/2 years with almost... with almost nothing to show for it. This is not about, this is not a story about procrastination. This is not a story about focus. This is this is a prophecy. This is about ctrl+alt+divinity, this is about the number sequence 142857 and how it relates to 369, this is about Cloud embassy, this is about How we pretend space is empty. This is about the formative principles that connect all things. This is about being an array of eyes without the synchronisation of of stereos stereoscopy. This is about the possibility of true randomness.. this is about a meeting I had where I said  I will never do that again and then I did it nonetheless. this is about turning on the lights when someone is sleeping. about the garden of Eden and planting an apple instead of eating it. This is about surfing and hitting a turtle. This is about growing up in a place where no one looks like you And identifying for the rest of your life as an aberrant pixel on an LCD screen. this is about putting everything you’ve ever written in a box decorated with monkeys. This is about life as an unidentified flying entity. This is about coffee staining your teeth. This is about mood rings turning a hallucinated shade of magenta. this is about nothing becoming the most significant thing. this is about the people we impact and the people we aim to please. this is about filling your life with conditioned identities. This is about releasing into the freedom of routine. This is about choosing to dream.

f I forget all that is me, and I tune my all outwards, maybe I will find consistency.

Prompt to self - internal shocking

If you catch me in the act of proclaiming I have freed myself from style, it is not to say that I now pursue objectivity, but rather that I no longer care about exerting my taste profile on others. for what I present is a psychological network that will always impact regardless of the artifacts that it produces, that it is in my grid to impact, and that the only thing I am interested in right now, is in setting my goal to clear my field, and to achieve that, and to know that I have achieved it by becoming the impact of order and harmony. And I am so far from that, given that every time I write, I present chaos solidified after so many lifetimes that it has become a sort of egregor-avatar.

video ideas

energetically seeking order and manifesting total hoarder

if I oculd only take one thing with me... one file, one of each thing... a return to noah's ark, that I am noah's ark. that I am the memory. the only memories surfacing in me, really, are the interference pattern on what I see. there is a slight moire over what I see, a slight ripple over every vision (pictures of parents, just ripples, just that interaction - next video idea)

something in me, a memory of having everything taken away, but instead, I choose to say goodbye in this lifetime, to die to my self, so that I may open up to everyone else.

pointlessness is the purest field of possibility.
pointlessness is futile.
different genres of impossible - there are certain impossibilities that are not pointless, for they converge into a point. they take a field and collapse it.
there are other impossibilities that diffuse intent completely into latency. or entropy.
the shock to my system, is to let go of those impossibilities in favor of others.
there is no point in knowing everything. There is a point, in knowing how to know, through what is immediately applicable and connected to the whole. connected to the point of all this.
which point within the field? which needle in the haystack?

We created AI to understand things that we thought were incomprehensible. like the human mind. the dystopian fear is only the faer of the unknown. but in fact, through AI we will know. and then it won't be so scary. we are simply afraid of our own minds. We just need to know them better. know the mind as a pattern. know ourselves as archetypes. know that we are not as conscious as we think to be. That we are mostly playing out roles, That all this data, is to prove, that we are not so complex, and that we don't need it.

noah's ark. cloud embassy. one of everything. but then again, not really. just the access point, through the one, to everything.
