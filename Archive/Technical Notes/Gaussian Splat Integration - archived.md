# Gaussian Splat Integration

## Core Approach

### Splat as Fog Map
```
Purpose:
- Document the spaces between
- Show fog as form
- Map force fields
- Build portal potential

Like Painting:
- Layer building
- Light capture
- Space creation
- Form emergence
```

### Technical Setup
```
TouchDesigner Flow:
1. Raw Input
   - Process photos
   - Thread arrangements
   - Force maps
   - Pattern studies

2. Splat Processing
   - Density mapping
   - Force field integration
   - Pattern recognition
   - Portal building

3. Output Forms
   - Cloud formations
   - Force visualizations
   - Pattern maps
   - Portal glimpses
```

## Documentation Methods

## Remember

Splats should:
- Show real process
- Map true forces
- Document patterns
- Build portals

Never:
- Force effects
- Rush process
- Fake integration
- Hide gaps

Success looks like:
- True documentation
- Clear forces
- Real patterns
- Open portals
