# 100 Days - Core Protocol

## Foundation: The Three Inversions

The practice operates through three simultaneous inversions, each revealing what was always present:

### Temporal Inversion (142857 Sequence)
The practice moves through time as a continuous revelation rather than linear progression. Each moment contains both its origin and becoming, expressed through the Line of Supervision:
- 1 → 4: Origin reveals method
- 4 → 2: Method reveals pattern
- 2 → 8: Pattern reveals force
- 8 → 5: Force reveals form
- 5 → 7: Form reveals principle

### Spatial Inversion (Container Protocol)
Space becomes active rather than passive, with each point simultaneously center and periphery:
- External Container: Physical practice space
- Internal Container: Attention field
- Interface Layer: Where visible meets invisible

### Force Inversion (Manifestation Field)
Forces reveal themselves through their effects, allowing precise mapping:
- Form shows force
- Effect shows cause
- Matter shows principle

## 100 Days Structure
