Cloud Embassy as the Plane of Knowledge. It is where books, materials, sounds, etc. interact on these boards (rectangular, as if they are windows), and reveal the interactions as well as the rollout of those spaces. Whether they return something harmonic that will continue to grow and exist and create actual structure, a lattice of life supporting structure, or whether they basically self-destruct into chaos. Each of these windows is a tuning station and a chance to basically "prompt" and test knowledge by itself, together, etc. to see what results. The patterning of that space reveals also what dimension it is, what it represents. Most importantly, you should be able to take for example a medication + a body and put them in this space, and read the interactions over time. That way understanding the total timeline of what that prompt will lead to, or what that commingling of assets will lead to. 

So, visually it is a modular world of components that seem to be aggregated around open square windows, and the spaces within those windows are revealing total collapsed timeliens in the forms of imagery that we can read, immediately, as to whether they are worth pursuing or not. This could be like a library, or it could be some sort of portal world... would have to test this out and build over time. I would not want to prompt cloud embassy for it is itself devoid of decoration, it is the canvas, and blocks, with all of the decoration / affectation happening within those blocks.  The organization should be happening through holistic systems, and not by genre of information becuase it's the genre of information that doesn't reveal how some sources are broken or misleading in subtle ways.

#### Descriptions of this World

1. it is not a different made up world. It is actually base reality or a deeper reality, and we are simply creating this Embassy space to adjust to it, so that we can start to see it. Very different from creating a fantasy world that is at odds with life around it. Should always feel that you‚Äôre drawing closer to base reality through imaginations / depictions / explorations of this cloud embassy world.
2. We must live from the position that we speak from. Cloud embassy is the creation of a space which is actually base reality, and from there, nothing is a hypothetis or whatever, it is actually what people live and thrive in. And so anything that comes from there resonates with truth, and real potential, because it is already happening.

#### Who am I?

1. I believe that there are many things deeply wrong with this world. That we exist in a nightmarish state of contrast and conflict which results in a total upheaval of priorities. This is not a world that I can exist in, or find peace in, however I believe that it is only a layer‚Äî a temporary layer‚Äîupon a base reality that actually makes sense. that is self-consistent. That supports growth.

	The paradigm today or the cult of nature actually shows how removed we are from even understanding a base reality. Because inherent in nature is a lot of the conflict, the eating, the recycling, etc. that definitely fosters what happens with us. But it is MORE self balancing, less identity-driven, and therefore already presents a better model‚Ä¶ that is why certain forms in nature evoke a deeper understanding or harmony in us because they always conform to laws of the material universe.
	However, as humans with a sense of ego, a sense of self, we intentionall;y barricaded ourselves from the forces of nature BECAUSE they kill the self, they kill identity, and they commit you to an endless cycle of recycling. This is very tough for us to handle and actually doesn‚Äôt necessary have to be an either or. WE are not going back to nature. The cult of nature worship forgets the ego development that we can‚Äôt backtrack on. It denies what all our ancestors did to give us this chance to exist as stewards of this world, in a sort of higher harmony, where we can choose what we want to participate in, where we can give ourselves a better chance at something transcendent.

Wev‚Äôe forgotten the transcendent though. Instead, we have given ourselves this time, this space, to contemplate, but because we have no guidance in that way and because there are other forces on this earth, on this plane, that desire more feeding, more recycling, and notice the incredible power inside of each us, then we have totally left open this new space (what I will call leisure space henceforth) to be turned against us and for us to totally create the drama of nature without the system that holds it in check. In other words, we have become agents of recycling, destruction, in of ourselves, without a system of checks and balances, which means we have almost completely succumbed to the destructive and enslaved vectors of this existence.

I purport that before we can do anything that improves our situation we have to first STRIP AWAY the conditioning that has inverted our reality. Some examples of that inversion are: the creative fields are the most competitive, when in fact they should be the ones imagining and collaborating on a better vision of this world. The ones improving realistically what life can be for all of us. The ones, coordinating on meaning. Setting a direction for society and personal and interpersonal growth.

Instead, we have agents understanding the power of creativity and basically infecting all creative fields with the most banal of animal impulses - domination, conflict, replaying of dramas, over and over again. IT is an obvious symptom of a cancerous society that we have global pressing issues like poverty, war, environmental collapse, and yet we spend billions of money on micro-worlds like movies and video games where there are basically heightened and amplified animal dynamics - more conflict, more drama, more war, etc. Those worlds that we create are actually transforming us into even more unconscious actors, playing out the game masters‚Äô wills, rather than giving us the SPACE to evolve differently and grow inwardly. Isn‚Äôt this a massive inversion?

CONSCIOUS PARTICIPATION IN FUNDAMENTAL REALTY CANNOT BE CONDITIONAL. That means, everyone has a chance to participate. Of course, we may have conditioned definitions of what "participation" looks like - but what we really have to understand is that, no matter the neurology, the physical state, the ability, etc.. a conscious being can still love and be loved. And that is participation. We all must rise to the level at which we can participate, without seeing it as a hierarchy. It just what our experience is calling for in this moment. We will cycle through all states!!!

"inefficiency is where value is captured in the current paradigm" - SO FUCKED UP
