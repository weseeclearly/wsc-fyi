NAME

Every day is spent in forming the key to unlock the door to cloud embassy.
there are 100 doors. when they are all unlocked, the labyrinth unfolds.

The name of today's door is: resourcefulness

the lock is: interference
the key is: dominion


The naming of the day. The conjuring of the guardians.

The day ritual which we carry through every single day from hereon out

It is best at the earliest point of the day, just when having risen out of bed, to declare the alignment with the day and to remove all attachments that will fester and grow outsized, if not removed immediately. It is best to remove these things EARLY in the day and maintain your BOUNDARIES early on, feed the boundaries rather than feed the vampires. IF that makes sense. Your energy has to go somewhere, so you might as well direct it toward the boundaries which will help maintain your clear sight.


The intention every day is to build a bridge to cloud embassy. to make it more and more real through creating a world that begins to exist on its own. There are prerequisites to even being in the place to do so, and part of that is also in the jump out of this repetitive life and into a pure and conscious calling.

there cannot be things pulling at you. Or if they are, they should be pulling you TOWARD the single focus, not away from it. anything that pulls your attention away from the single focus must go.

Every single day will filter out more adventurers, and that is ok. It is not their time. If you fall off, then it is not your time. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. you will eventually always reach the destination, and when you get there you will look back and see that everything makes sense.

The "short cut" is a lie. If you do not have the energy to sustain a faster path, then you will fall even harder. There will be some that can follow day to day, can actually expedite probably faster than me, and we will help each other and keep each other company, and also pave the path more cleanly for those that come after. It is how things are. I am happy to also be in proper pace with myself, to surround myself with people with equal or slightly higher aptitude, because motivation is real, group effort and focus is real, but at the same time, it still has to be synchronized because if it's too much of a gap, there will be injuries.

Today is all about resources. 

every hour I will check in, write down what I did in focus blocks, to keep myself completely on path. I will remove all obstacles ax they show up, and not give any extra energy , not let energy saps compound. I will document in order to be transparent.

My list of No's - 
not looking for property
no shopping on amazon
no sweets
no junk food
no no no
just make it all about NOs right now. and then you will only have a couple options. and then you will do what you need to do.
it's so simple!!!!

Like a sound without color 




I was wiped clean by memory


Day 1 of 100 days of transformation.

Identifying a behavioral pattern that I want to change. Something that I want to incubate.

The fool. leading with creativity, leading with the impulse from source to create, and unify, through action.

If I only had 100 days left to feel truly alive

I would want to prove to myself that this life was worth it. And I don't just mean by reaching out to people who love me, though that's definitely part of it. But by making sure that when I leave, I don't leave a mess. That when I leave, there was good that came out of this life. That I left the world slightl ybetter than how I came here.

It's a challenge I extend to everyone in my circle, and theirs to theirs. We don't have unlimited time, though we live like it and tend to treat the world like it can handle unlimited abuse. What if took a different hypothesis - that it's time to grow up? it's time to change? and there's no better time than now?

I don't want to generate text every day. I want to SOURCE From what I've already done (since my memory os blank) and reconsistute my life, and then go from there. Rather than try to build something up from scratch. That is the premise of cloud embassy.

Ok so let's just pull together all of our best words in one place. The monkey box! one place. All of the best. Then have AI organize it into a single page, where I can then use clouds to basically pull out different sentences and make meanings out of them. 

REMEMBERING
is basically the prompt of the 100 days
that's fine. Transformation through this one action, through this one consolidation of everything I've done from the very beginning.
Freeing of the subconscious.
for me, the cleanup TAKES that long. There's al ot that I've collected. IT's time to take the best of the best and make something of it.
The cloud garments that reveal just parts of trims and such.
the cloud book that reveals just parts of a page, over a year or over 100 days or whateve.r Cloud slides, that hide and reveal different parts
the embassy is taking form but no one person cans ee the whole thing. it is built in our collective imagination.

Tkae the best, and discard the rest. !


to see things as they really are. to be true and celebratory of where you are. to aspire to perfection within truth of where you are. to be fully transparent, not to expose, but to celebrate the truth of being as you are. which invites change as well. for there is only the now. there is only this now.

clouds also translate

not pushing anything. showing up in that space, and remembering to see more and more of what truly is, now. to open the aperture to what is happening now. It is enough. because there is infinite here.

Clouds, represent the filling in, the visualization of space, it is empty space that we don't think about until clouds show the movements. vapor as well, like a smoke machine with lasers. to see all of that, is to beh ere now.

cloud embassy, the applied approach, to be with what is, to add the clouds to fillin the space, to draw attention to the space, to the details, to what went into making something. that is the aesthetic artistic approach. why there can alwys be more seen and more accepted and more weighed.

externalities. it is ALL about externalities. it is about internalizing the externalities.
