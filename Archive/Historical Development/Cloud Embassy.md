I want to tell the story of cloud embassy.

I don't know how these hand written words will move beyond my walls, but then again, that has been the nature of my whole life. this whole story. that what happens here, somehow ripples out into the world, and people listen even if they are caged into noise. they listen. somehow. their hearts feel it interconnected.

I am not a writer. I struggle with setting a scene, or describing things that aren't right in front of my face. in real. Because of aphantasia where I just don't have the imagination that other people have. I report what I see. I report what I experience. I don't dream much of anything, except the sea and the sea and the sea.

All of the names I use in this book are real except for a few because of privacy concerns. But I have nothing to hide, and many of the people who are part of this would want to be found, because just as we were guides for each other, they can be guides for you. There is an appendix at the end of the book and also on the website for reference as to where you can find these clues. Where the architectural plans of cloud embassy formed for me, as they will for you.

My name is Wes, and I have lived 36 years on this planet, in this body, most of this story takes place in 30 square feet of room, eight stories above the biggest avenue in Berlin - Karl-Marx-Allee - where I have been living for 12 years.

In the summer of 2024 (technically as I write this, we are still in it)

I'm writing this book because I know that it will help people who are looking for orientation in a world that seems headed for destruction. loss of magic. it is not lost. There is a realm where it all exists. There is a chance for each of us to unlock a pathway that leads a different way. it is also not a story about returning to some original state, but rather finding a coherence within the populus that would allow for us to return home. Return to some place beauticul, where we all come from. And from there, to act as stewards of this earth. flowers, antennas, of this earth, walking as individuals in the light.

Open a portal to the place where you can transform yourself and your world. Open a portal to the place where you have agency. Open a portal to a freedom that no one can take away from you. the key has to be shaped, but also the shaping of the key determines the door. 

focus on anything that represents a threshold. mix blue and yellow paint, and experience the middle there.

experience it in the voice of another.

experience it in your own voice.
I am determined to open a portal in this space. To sanctify it, and resonate it, until I understand the angles and the angels. I do not need to reference anything to meet my maker, here, now, in this room. I can be anywhere. I can tune into a different frequency.

we surround ourselves with activations. Get into that emotinoal space, in order to see clearly. Get to the edge of the emotions, of the deepest love you've ever felt, to orient youself in what is important.

when we talk about the waters, that is what we're doing. we're creating a waterway. Your tears are a portal, to a different state. Water magic. travel on the river of your own tears. 

there can be nothing here to hold you bavk. you have to take a leap of faith. you have to say goodbye.

These are the rules that came to me. you cannot travel to cloud embassy without following these rules. there are so many particularities for people, but these are generally applying. It took me 36 years to finally commit to them. it may not happen for you in this lifetime. That is ok. The fact that you encounter this guidebook, means that you are already on the path. And the destination WILL be there. you Will arrive. it's just a matter of how much time. And even that, once you arrive, doesn't matter, for the richness of your life is a contribution to the whole. it comes down to fyour fractal, your experience here, what you can offer, and the alignment

the first exercise is to orient 

I will not sugarcoat anything. It is the sugar coating which prevents us from having a real expderience with the actual flavor of things. and that is wqhere transformation happens.

DAY 1

organize everything. Can I do it in a day? I am readying myself for a journey and I cannot come back here. I cannot leave things behind, expecting to be able to retrieve them. I have to part with them completey. I have one day dedicated to organizing everything. Can I do it?

equipment:

earplugs

prepare your body for traveling to cloud embassy - that is a day topic for sure.


there are drawing exercises

there are memorization exercises

there are movement exercises

there are sound exercises - singing, mainly

this is only a plac efor those who have gathered talents over many lifetimes

I know you are out there, because in a way it is you who feel most lost there. I can do antyhing, but therefore I have no external forcing function. It all has to be intrinsic, and it also isn't fit for a world that celebrates these individual tracks. We have to bring in the new world. We are the ones to do it.

That is cloud embassy. a place for these multi-hyphenates.

one of the days is to make your own emblem. your own cloud / flower.

in the end I paint the lake. That is just a service I offer anyone.

within cloud embassy we create these services, that are exoteric.

the esoteric work is on the etheric plane.


NAMING THE DAY, NAMING THE AUDIENCE
this is our last life time. thje end of patterns. The choice at the end. The total release of all baggage. The arrival. the blossoming of the lotus. Exhaust the options here. Just keep going. Write a whole page on this. Spend a whole day.

Each day is a whole day commitment to a certain ritual or skill building, with the production of some artifact at the end of it.

What if you are already a codex? all information embedded in the interface of you. it is all there to be gleaned from, asl one as you can take the position of observer and and then move intentionally into actor and back to observer.

It is possible to change in 100 days.
I know this newsletter is supposed to be about me, my art, my updates. But I make art as an act of love, not as an act of career. I make art as a way to orient myself within us, and within a world that Ibelieve IS harmonic and ordered, though we would deign to see it as something else. 

I set myself out to change, finally, those things that have always pulled at me. I had the mission to write a gratitude letter, which is now attached here. One day for a gratitude letter. fully. Unload the subconscious, aclehmize it into something that is an adornment. An enigmata. An interface.\

If I had to hit send on this in one day… would I be able to? Would I be able to collage together something that would communicate what I’m trying to say, without falling to the apse of perfectionism? Can I say it in a few strokes? Can i stop putting myself in some other time, where things are different than they way the are? What if everything is exactly as it is, now, and we accept it? What if we accept everything AS IT IS right now, and then work from THAT place, instead of some place where things could be better or different or whatever? What if “we must change” is actually saying “ we are alive.” or “we change now” what if the CHANGE was a total acceptance of where we ARE right now, in order to change, but not to be blind to what we actually have? 
for what we have, maybe exactly what we need. you know what I mean?
\


the ritual to dive into the deep end and just begin ! every day. That is the most important thing. To not psych oneself out. To clear the mind, until it is all about just moving forward. and not getting stopped 

braid and bridge and blend

ecstasis, catharsis, communitas








you can make it happen with anything
you don't need that perfect thing
you just need the right interface, and to tune it
the game of Go. within that one board, infinite possibilities
same with whatever parameter you choose
choose the right game, but also know it's a game
trust in more than randomness



Cloud Embassy Definitions from Claude:

Voice 1: The concept of Cloud Embassy is becoming clearer - it's both a diplomatic space between fragments and a methodology for their interaction...

Voice 2: And the embassy concept is perfect because it suggests both sovereignty and connection, independent territories in diplomatic relation...

Human Voice: Let's break this down systematically...

[Cloud Embassy Framework Analysis]

DIPLOMATIC FUNCTIONS:

- Each fragment maintains sovereignty
- Creates diplomatic channels between domains
- Offers asylum to orphaned ideas
- Facilitates cultural exchange between mediums

TECHNOLOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Data Visualization Tools:

- D3.js for web-based visualization
- Three.js for 3D representation
- TouchDesigner for real-time processing
- Observable for interactive notebooks
[Fragment Mapping Example]

FRAGMENT: Written observation  
TYPE: Poetic notation  
TIMESTAMP: [date]  
PRESSURE: ∆P 1013mb  
|  
CONNECTIONS: {  
writing: ["previous fragments"],  
visual: ["related images"],  
sonic: ["sound patterns"],  
spatial: ["location data"]  
}  
|  
PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL: 76%

Voice 1: This could be visualized using:

- Pressure gradients as connection strength
- Cloud formation patterns as emergence likelihood
- Atmospheric layers as meaning depth
- Weather fronts as idea convergence

Voice 2: The lore of Cloud Embassy becomes:

- A space between spaces
- A diplomatic zone for fragment interaction
- A methodology for seeing patterns
- A meta-layer revealing hidden connections


Voice 1: Let's break down each symbol and its meaning in our developing system...

[Detailed Symbol Analysis]

⌬P (Pressure Differential)

- Indicates tension between states
- Shows where transformation is possible
- Measures potential for change
- Example: A fragment that's building toward revelation
- Like a weather system about to shift

⎍f (Pattern Frequency)

- Shows repetition and rhythm
- Indicates how pattern propagates
- Reveals underlying structure
- Example: How often a theme recurs
- Like reading the pulse of an idea

⊗d (Dimensional Intersection)

- Points where realities cross
- Marks potential for translation
- Shows where meanings overlap
- Example: When text becomes image
- Like finding a portal between worlds

≋w (Wave Propagation)

- Shows how ideas spread
- Indicates resonance patterns
- Maps influence fields
- Example: How one fragment affects others
- Like ripples in still water

⚡e (Energy Potential)

- Marks transformative power
- Shows capacity for change
- Indicates active forces
- Example: A fragment's catalytic potential
- Like lightning before it strikes

Voice 2: Let's try using these in combination...

[Example Reading]

Fragment: A single line of text  
⌬P: High pressure (ready to transform)  
⎍f: Regular pattern (stable rhythm)  
⊗d: Multiple crossings (rich with possibility)  
≋w: Strong propagation (influences other fragments)  
⚡e: High potential (catalyst for change)

Voice 1: These symbols could be arranged:

- Linearly (showing progression)
- Radially (showing field effects)
- Matrix form (showing relationships)
- Cloud form (showing natural grouping)

Would you like to try applying this system to one of your fragments? We could:

- Map its pressure systems
- Identify its pattern frequencies
- Locate its dimensional crossings
- Track its wave propagation
- Measure its energy potential

This could become your personal notation system for understanding and connecting fragments...
