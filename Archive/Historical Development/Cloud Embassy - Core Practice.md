# Cloud Embassy: Core Practice

## The Interface Practice

Cloud Embassy operates through seeing forces at play. The practice moves between artistic work and life navigation, drawing interfaces on encountered spaces, mapping present forces, and recognizing patterns of transformation.

### Force Mapping
When entering a space or situation, step back into clear observation. Work with projective geometry to create diagrams that hold their own internal perspective and logic, independent of external grids.

The practice uses three elements:
- **Arrows**: Movement and force direction, drawn with precision
- **Points**: Centers of energy and transformation, placed with intention
- **Fields**: Spaces between, marked by what emerges

These elements create a complete interface - a way of seeing and understanding that connects surface and depth.

### First Pieces
Cloud Embassy begins by analyzing what exists. Initial pieces appear as force maps marked on:
- Room and space photographs
- Traditional patterns and textiles
- Current arrangements and situations

These maps demonstrate our way of seeing - perceiving forces of space and pattern, observing how objects arrange themselves to interface, recognizing relationships beyond physical form.

## The Space

### Room of Supervision
The physical space of Cloud Embassy serves as practice ground. Each morning starts with observation:

Light enters at dawn, casting shadows that map forces across surfaces. Before beginning work, document this movement. Desk, wall, floor - each surface shows how forces move and transform throughout the day.

Observation includes:
- Tool arrangements on desk surfaces
- Fragment positions along walls
- Movement patterns across floors
- Transformation points in space

### Documentation Practice
Documentation serves both practical and analytical purposes:

**Morning Light Study**:
1. Enter space with presence
2. Mark how light creates force fields
3. Document with precise drawings
4. Note where patterns emerge
5. Mark portal points

**Evening Integration**:
1. Review force movements
2. Map transformations
3. Document with images and lines
4. Note what has emerged
5. Prepare next day's practice

## Working with Fragments

Force mapping reveals relationships between fragments. Gaps between pieces matter equally - force diagrams show potential movements and transformations within these spaces.

### Fragment Practice
When working with any fragment (text, fabric, practice moment):

1. Document exactly what's present
2. Map visible forces
3. Note the gaps
4. Draw the interface
5. Mark natural connections

This practice applies to:
- Voice note fragments
- Physical material pieces
- Daily practice moments
- Room documentation elements

## The Will/Purpose

Will acts as the active force in seeing and practice, expressing through:

1. **Clear Seeing**:
   - Present observation
   - Interface awareness
   - Force recognition
   - Transformation marking

2. **True Practice**:
   - Daily documentation
   - Force mapping
   - Pattern recognition
   - Portal opening

3. **Natural Expression**:
   - Force maps become prints
   - Interfaces become products
   - Practice becomes offering
   - Transformation becomes visible

## Remember

Practice works when:
- Observation stays clear
- Forces map precisely
- Patterns show themselves
- Portals open naturally

Work requires:
- Simple directness
- Precise marking
- Clear mystery
- Complete presence

Each moment contains:
- Space to step back
- Forces to map
- Patterns to mark
- Portals to open
