Who stocks the tourist shop tshirts?
who designs the slogan tshirts that you find in chinese markets?
using those avenues as guerilla distribution, to get bigger messages out

what is a body without tension?
what is a closet without clothes?
what is a phone without photos?
what is a gallery without paintings?
how to hold a space of potential
and then play with it, and not get addicted to potential either
how to be fre weith our ideas
how to be strong and not just default to the first thing that offers to displace us or it
be creative about seeing what is in the space, the diversity of it, rather than the obtuseness of the one thing that could replace it
how can I hold space for all that I am and not just be pulled in directions left and right
how can I create this kind of strength
how can I play with space, like an orange tree
what magnificent plays of space, an orange tree evolving to make something with the air, to decorate it
to play compositionally


having an organized room, being able to hold SPACE within an apartment per say, or in your own closet, or how yuou decorate, not filling every nook and cranny... is a spiritual defense. it shows how you operate energetically. that you won't be susceptible to every cancer that wants to lodge itself into you.
now, there are extreme version of tightness where there's no flow. that's  something else. I guess we have to feel into that

My definition of a dancer is - wow, how creative are you with the space around your body. how many ways can you shape yourself within this little area of air. what is actually directing those movements? tracing things out. 

how many ways can I move my body.

ambidexterity

how creative can I be with these six dollars?

What could I do with these six dollars 

what can I do with this little profile picture space?

How can I totally do something else, can i consider the larger space I'm in?

Can I reconsider everything about this space, and basically enact the superposition of all possibilities and then pull the LEASET expected?
the least expected .... every time.

the least expected path to the kitchen would be to stop in the closet every time and pick one thing up

to be able to adhere to my own schedule despite the nagging of all these other space encroachers... is a spiritual mission

to actually take care of the problems I'm conscious of is like, life alignment 101.
