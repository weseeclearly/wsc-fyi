I envision an entirely different landscape or emergent landscape of content that is actually more about revealing bias and connections and probability fields, like navigating satellite imagery rather than zooming into a single person’s opinion… for a more overview. of course you can zoom in, you can identify the storms, but yo can also zoom out just as easily. and I imagine this interface to also have new media conglomerates that are not owned by a single entity but rather come together, like storm systems, in order to reveal something, and then they shift apart and direct resources elsewhere.


This kind of does away with the whole need for branding as assets would be developed in a more modular and fluid way. \

first dismantling a lot of the current media just by exposing bias but only in a way that machines can do.because they do not serve the same masters that humans do ( basically, humans serve themselves, and every impulse to become a slave, is because fear of their own well being… it’s not a natural subservience but it’s out of self protection. easier to be a slave than to have to think for yourself. simple as that)

seeing clearly

all of the vocabulary of cloud embassy kind of serving this one vision

and my process is very much about dropping these little notes…. basically creating all of the little fragments, and having agents also put them together into a storyline so that I can literally come in here like this with just a million spurting ideas and then it can generate a month of tweets. because my agents are able to parse it out and organize it and edit it and give me that list. that plan for social media. I just have to review the plan.

So I Want to build an AI agent system that can basically update me every day with my emails, with the twitter plan, the scheduling, etc. and I just have to basically drop my voice notes once in a while and then it will take care of the rest for me. that kind of update . 

it can summarize what I Worked on and also share that. somehow take screenshots of what I’m doing

What would the visuals of the new media, the post-content weather map type stuff, what would the imagery be? well, it would serve to educate people who to read these weather maps. IT would be somehow related to that, somehow related to showing probabilistic fields. not generative art but generative revealing. identify people in this fleld

ok another thing the agents would do is… cold email or basically research who is working in it and approach them from the agent perspective. dry. this would help me because I’m not so good at formulating how to reach out and maintain those relationships. 

interfacer. what would it take to build an interface layer to twitter? a weather map?
what would it take to break down every KOL into just a probability field. oh this is going to be said. oh but if you say this, then it goes in this direction and the world follows. markets as probability fields? to play with timelines. to be a timeline dancer.


using agent framework to clean up my life

and to help me stay on track. when I want to eat, it would be impossible to directly overcome hunger, butI can bring in an assisting octave, a photo of my ideal something or whatever, and then find the energy to resist. those kinds of aids and assistances, moving into their scales or octaves and coming back…
