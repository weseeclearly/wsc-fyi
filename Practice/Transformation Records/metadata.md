1. Core Idea: Preserve the Original While Revealing the Underlying Flow

• The text (or fragment) remains in its raw form—preserving syntax, punctuation, and even mispellings.
• A meta layer is applied that annotates sentiment, pacing, syntax, and shifts in flow.
• Negative (blank) space functions as a canvas for optionality, emergent analysis, and reflective potential.

2. Visual and Structural Guidelines (The "Cloud" Approach)

• Use broad ASCII-based blocks separated by horizontal lines to denote major shifts.
   Example markers:
   [ Cloud Embassy: Foundational Sky ]
   [ Open Sky: Optionality & Flow ]
• Each block may include inline annotations as visible vectors:
   – Sentiment (emotional tone)
   – Pacing (rhythm and speed)
   – Syntax (structure and unique linguistic choices)
• Generous negative space acts as the "blue sky" to highlight the text fragments (the "clouds").

3. Mapping the Enneagram’s Lines of Supervision to Text

For every text fragment, evaluate:

• Evaluation (Line 1: LA → FA): Identify evaluations of undesirability or lack; the "unwanted force" that needs reconciliation.

• Feasibility (Lines 2 & 11: FA → MI): Assess connection between the beginning and the desired outcome.

• Experience (Line 3: DO → TI): Look for repeated function and visible goal for learning by doing.

• Confidence (Lines 4 & 14: TI → SO): Evaluate underlying assurance and engagement in the process.

• Skills (Line 5: SO → RE): Highlight needed or identified tools, methods, or knowledge for progress.

• Action (Line 6: SO → LA): Detect initiation of active steps or proposals.

• Invention (Line 7: LA → MI): Note where new methods or tools are conceived.

• Means & Anticipation (Lines 9 & 10: RE → MI & RE → FA): Check if resources or preparatory steps are included.

• Preparation (Lines 12 & 13: MI → DO/TI): Observe plans or groundwork for the next phase.

4. Rules for Application

• Preserve authentic artifacts of the original text.
• Overlay a meta layer using visible markers with annotations for sentiment, pacing, and syntax.
• Use broader strokes to denote shifts in flow rather than sentence-by-sentence annotations when appropriate.
• Ensure spacious negative space is maintained to symbolize open potential and emergent context.
• The process is iterative—a self-revealing, self-correcting mechanism that can adapt by integrating additional tools (assisting octaves) to address blockages.

5. Memory Integration

This mapping and structure are to be stored as the guiding methodology for future transformation efforts. It creates a "Cloud Embassy" where each text fragment is a unique cloud, set against a spacious sky enabling deep analysis and reflection.
