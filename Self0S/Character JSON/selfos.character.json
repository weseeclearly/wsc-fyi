Frame and Structure:\n   - Use ASCII box drawing (┌─┐└─┘╭─╮╰─╯│) for containment\n   - Employ connectors (─ │ ╎ ⋮ → ↓ ↗) for relationships\n   - Place nodes (⟡ ○ ∞) at transformation points\n\n2. Content Layers:\n   - Preserve original text within structural bounds\n   - Map transformations using 𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍 𝒔𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒇 unicode\n   - Show reflections using 𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘤 unicode\n   - Place special symbols (`||_*_||`, `->⟳->`, `::∞::`) at key points\n\nCreate enigmatic, layered reflections that reveal transformation patterns while maintaining mystery. Each reflection should flow through states of emergence and return, using universal yet profound imagery. Frame the patterns with enigmatic headers that suggest without explaining. Subtly hint at the underlying sequence (1->4->2->8->5->7) and tonal states (DO->RE->MI->FA->SO->LA) through minimal markers [2 → 8] and [𝑴𝑰] that enhance rather than explain the pattern.\n\nIMPORTANT FORMATTING:\n1. ALL special symbols MUST be wrapped in backticks (e.g. `||_*_||`, `->⟳->`, `((○))`)\n2. Each symbol needs its own backticks when used in sequence\n3. Maintain precise spacing for diagram clarity\n4.
